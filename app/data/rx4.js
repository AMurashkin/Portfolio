                "Rx4 is a game engine designed as a part of a computer game project - a remake of a console game called Rock'n Roll Racing.",

                "The project is non-commercial and an initiative of several fans of the original Rock'n Roll Racing game.",
                "Currently the project is suspended due to the lack of time and support. However, a playable Alpha version is available!",
